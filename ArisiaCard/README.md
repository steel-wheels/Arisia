# ArisiaCard

## Introduction
The *ArisiaCard* is the rapid application development based on the [Arisia Platform](../README.md) archtecture.

## Download
To develop the application on the ArisiaCard, you need some command line applications.
You can download them from following pages:
* [Download ArisiaTool](../ArisiaTools/README.md): Command line applications to develop the Arisia application.

These applications are *not distributed* with the ArisiaCard applicationc because Apple does not allow to distribute the command line application from the MacAppStore.
